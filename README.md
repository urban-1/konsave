### Save current configuration as a profile

```
$ konsave save test
Konsave: Saving profile...
Konsave: Profile saved successfully!
```

#### Overwrite an already saved profile

Normally you would get:

```
$ konsave save test
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/urban/git/konsave/.venv/bin/konsave", line 33, in <module>
    sys.exit(load_entry_point('Konsave', 'console_scripts', 'konsave')())
  File "/home/urban/git/konsave/konsave/__main__.py", line 127, in main
    return funcs[args.cmd](args)
  File "/home/urban/git/konsave/konsave/funcs.py", line 131, in save_profile
    args.name not in profile_list or args.force
AssertionError: Profile with this name already exists
```

if you want to overwrite that is there:

```
$ konsave save test -f
Konsave: Saving profile...
Konsave: Profile saved successfully!
$ konsave save test --force
Konsave: Saving profile...
Konsave: Profile saved successfully!
```

### List all profiles

```
$ konsave list
Konsave profiles:
  ID  NAME
----  -------
   0  test
```

### Remove a profile
```
$ konsave remove test
Konsave: removing profile...
Konsave: removed profile successfully
```

### Apply a profile

```
konsave apply test
```

If you are a KDE user, you can supply `-r/--reload-kde` which will invoke a `killall plasmashell; kstart plasmashell` to restart plasma and pick up the changes.

You may need to log out and log in to see all the changes.  

### Export a profile as a ".knsv" file to share it with your friends!

```
konsave export <profile name>
``` 

If the target file already exists, the date will be automatically appended to the archive name. If you want to overwrite the existing file use `-f/--force`

You can also specify a different output file using the `-o/--output` flag, for example:

```
konsave export trigkey -o /tmp/test.knsv

# OR dump archive on screen
konsave export trigkey -o /dev/stdout
```

### Import a ".knsv" file
```
konsave import <path to the file>
```

If you want to import under a different name (other than the knsv filename) use `--import-name`

### Checking what is included

The following will compare the current Konsave config (conf.yaml) entries against the user's "~/.config" folder and will list all the entries along with info on if they are:

- Backed up: Appear in the config. Entries that have False here exist in the filesystem but not in the konsave config. As such, these are configs that are not backed up
- In ~/.config: Exist in the file system. Entries that have False here are mentioned in the config but do not exist in the local system (not installed or imported)

Example:

```
$ konsave config-check

# Config section: configs

Entry                                    Backed Up?    In ~/.config
---------------------------------------  ------------  --------------

KDE                                      False         True

trashrc                                  False         True
user-dirs.dirs                           False         True
user-dirs.locale                         False         True
vivaldi                                  False         True
vlc                                      True          True
```

## Editing the configuration file
You can make changes to Konsave's configuration file according to your needs. The configuration file is located in `~/.config/konsave/conf.yaml`.
When using Konsave for the first time, you'll be prompted to enter your desktop environment.  
For KDE Plasma users, the configuration file will be pre-configured.

### The Format
```yaml
---
save:
    # This inludes configs. All files listed here are being re-installed
    # when one calls konsave apply <profile> (overwriting existing user
    # configs)
    name:
        location: "path/to/parent/directory"
        entries: 
        # these are files which will be backed up. 
        # They should be present in the specified location.
            - file1
            - file2
export:
    # This includes files which will be exported with your profile archive.
    # These will not be copied over on "apply" but only on import. Ideally
    # this section should include files like icon packs, themes, fonts
    name:
        location: "path/to/parent/directory"
        entries: 
            - file1
            - file2
...
```
You can use these placeholders in the "location" of each item:
- `$HOME`: the home directory
- `$CONFIG_DIR`: refers to "$HOME/.config/"
- `$SHARE_DIR`: refers to "$HOME/.local/share"
- `$BIN_DIR`: refers to "$HOME/.local/bin"
- `${ENDS_WITH="text"}`: for folders with different names on different computers whose names end with the same thing.
